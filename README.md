# Comprehensive SCME Method

> A nonlinear large-deformation modeling framework for planar compliant mechanisms based on energy minimization.

**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## Overview

The **Comprehensive energy method based on the smooth curvature model (CoSCME)** is a modeling framework for analyzing the nonlinear large-deformation behavior of planar compliant mechanisms.

CoSCME extends the original **high-order SCME** method by incorporating **both bending deformation and axial deformation**, while explicitly accounting for the **coupling between these two deformation modes**. This comprehensive formulation enables accurate and efficient modeling of compliant mechanisms undergoing large deformations.
